# Social Media Ranking Algorithm Research

This repository is an experimental space for developing and testing ranking algorithms that prioritize **social benefits** over traditional metrics like engagement, profit, or traffic.

## The Challenge

Below is the main prompt being used to explore how we might design ranking algorithms that help humanity rather than maximize engagement:

### Additional Resources
- [Original Prompt](_includes/ranking-prompt.md)
- [Project Overview](README.md)

## Purpose

Current social media platforms optimize for metrics that maximize user attention and platform revenue, often at the expense of user wellbeing and societal health. This project explores alternative approaches to content ranking that could:

- Promote constructive discourse and meaningful interactions
- Reduce the spread of misinformation and harmful content
- Encourage diverse perspectives and reduce echo chambers
- Support mental health and positive user experiences
- Foster community building and genuine connections

## Status

This is an active research project exploring how technology can better serve human flourishing rather than corporate profits.
