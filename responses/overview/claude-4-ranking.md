1. **Misinformation**: Factually incorrect claims, especially about health or safety
2. **Hate speech**: Content targeting individuals or groups based on identity
3. **Addictive engagement tactics**: Deliberately manipulative content designed to exploit psychological vulnerabilities
4. **Conspiracy theories**: Unfounded claims that undermine trust in institutions or science
5. **Harmful lifestyle promotion**: Content encouraging dangerous behaviors

### Ranking Mechanism:
- **Content verification score** (0-100): Fact-checking, source credibility, expert validation
- **Constructive engagement score** (0-100): Quality of comments, productive discussions generated
- **Educational value score** (0-100): Knowledge transfer potential, skill-building opportunities
- **Empathy promotion score** (0-100): Likelihood to increase understanding and compassion
- **Solution orientation score** (0-100): Practical applicability and problem-solving potential
- **Harm mitigation score** (-100 to 0): Potential for causing psychological, social, or physical harm

**Final ranking = Weighted sum of positive scores - harm mitigation penalties**

## Implementation Strategies

### 1. Independent Platform Approach:
- Create a new social media platform with humanity-focused ranking from inception
- Transparent algorithm that users can understand and provide feedback on
- Community governance model for defining and refining "help humanity" criteria

## Conclusion

Designing a social media ranking algorithm that truly helps humanity requires a fundamental shift from engagement-maximization to well-being optimization. The core challenge lies in defining "help humanity" in a way that is inclusive, adaptive, and resistant to manipulation while still providing meaningful guidance for content prioritization.

Success depends on three critical factors: transparent and participatory governance that involves diverse stakeholders in defining and refining humanitarian goals; robust measurement systems that can accurately assess long-term impact on human flourishing rather than just short-term engagement; and adaptive mechanisms that allow the algorithm to evolve with changing societal needs and emerging understanding of what constitutes genuine benefit to humanity.

The implementation pathway likely requires a combination of approaches—new platforms designed from the ground up with humanitarian principles, meta-ranking systems that can be applied to existing platforms, and integration with open protocols that enable algorithmic choice. Most importantly, this system must remain fundamentally human-centered, using technology as a tool to amplify human wisdom and values rather than replacing human judgment with purely computational approaches. The ultimate measure of success will not be user engagement or platform growth, but tangible improvements in human knowledge, empathy, well-being, and collective problem-solving capacity.
