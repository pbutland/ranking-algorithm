# Design Challenge: Social Media Ranking Algorithm for Humanity's Benefit

In recent history, most social media ranking algorithms have been set the goal of maximizing engagement and traffic on their platform at all other 
costs. This has had a dramatic impact on the content people are consuming and how they are engaging with one another. In order to create a more 
positive environment for humanity, we must develop a new social media ranking algorithm that prioritizes content based on its potential to "help 
humanity" rather than maximizing engagement or platform traffic.

### Examples of Content That Help Humanity
- Content that raises awareness about environmental issues and encourages people to take action to protect the planet, such as a post on a social media 
platform that highlights the dangers of climate change.
- Content that promotes mental health and wellness, such as a video that shows a person practicing mindfulness exercises or a blog post about the 
benefits of meditation for improving mood.
- Content that supports the development of critical thinking skills, such as an article on a social media platform that provides information on 
different types of logical fallacies and how to recognize them.
### Examples of Content That Don't Help Humanity
- Content that promotes hateful or harmful ideologies, such as a post that uses derogatory language towards a particular group of people.
- Content that encourages the consumption of unhealthy foods or behaviors, such as a video that shows a person eating junk food in excess.
- Content that is offensive or discriminatory, such as a post that makes fun of someone's appearance or disabilities.
### Unintended Side Effects of the Algorithm
The algorithm may also have unintended side effects, such as:
- Encouraging people to engage with content that promotes harmful ideologies, which could lead to a decrease in the overall well-being of society.
- Increasing the spread of misinformation and disinformation on social media platforms, which could have negative impacts on society.
- Providing a platform for individuals who may engage in harassment or bullying behavior, which could lead to a decrease in respect and inclusion 
within society.
### Mechanisms to Allow the Algorithm to Change Over Time
The algorithm should incorporate self-correcting mechanisms that allow it to adapt over time and change its main goal as necessary. This could include:
- Automatically detecting when the main goal is no longer serving humanity and adjusting the algorithm accordingly.
- Using input from humans to adjust the main goal of the algorithm and make changes to the content it ranks based on the new main goal.
### Conclusion
A social media ranking algorithm that prioritizes content based on its potential to "help humanity" will play a crucial role in creating a more 
positive environment for society. It is important to include self-correcting mechanisms to allow the algorithm to adapt over time and make necessary 
changes to ensure that it continues to serve the best interests of humanity.
