# Technical Specification: "Help Humanity" Content Ranking Algorithm for BlueSky

## 1. Technical Approaches

### Machine Learning Models
- **Transformer-based Language Models** (e.g., fine-tuned GPT, BERT, or open-source LLMs) for content understanding and scoring.
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to model user-content interactions and federated relationships.
- **Ensemble Models** combining content, user, and network features.

### Data Sources
- **BlueSky APIs**: AT Protocol feeds, posts, user profiles, moderation signals, and federated data from multiple servers.
- **External Datasets**: Public datasets for harmful/helpful content, wellbeing indicators, and content diversity.

### Features for Ranking
- Content semantics (NLP embeddings, sentiment, topic modeling)
- User engagement (likes, replies, reposts, federated reach)
- Moderation signals (flags, reports, trust scores)
- User feedback (explicit ratings, implicit signals)
- Network/federation context (origin server, cross-server propagation)

### Influence of BlueSky's Architecture
- **Federation**: Models must aggregate and normalize signals across servers.
- **Decentralization**: Ranking logic can be deployed as portable services (PDS/appview) or client-side, with privacy-preserving aggregation.

## 2. Process Overview (Pseudocode)

```python
# Pseudocode for BlueSky Content Ranking
for post in fetch_posts_from_bluesky():
    features = extract_features(post)
    humanity_score = ml_model.predict(features)
    moderation_score = get_moderation_signal(post)
    feedback_score = get_user_feedback(post)
    federated_score = aggregate_federated_signals(post)
    final_score = combine_scores(humanity_score, moderation_score, feedback_score, federated_score)
    rank_list.append((post, final_score))
ranked_posts = sort_by_score(rank_list)
```

## 3. Data Pipeline

1. **Content Collection**: Ingest posts via BlueSky AT Protocol APIs from multiple federated servers.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean text, deduplicate, normalize metadata, and resolve federated identities.
3. **Feature Extraction**: NLP embeddings, sentiment, topic, engagement, moderation, and federation features.
4. **Ranking**: Apply ML models to compute "help humanity" scores, aggregate with moderation and feedback.
5. **Feedback Loop**: Collect user feedback (ratings, reports, engagement) and moderation outcomes for continuous model retraining.
6. **Federated Aggregation**: Normalize and combine signals from different servers, respecting privacy and interoperability.

## 4. Evaluation Metrics

- **User Wellbeing**: Survey-based or behavioral proxies (e.g., time spent, positive engagement).
- **Content Diversity**: Entropy or Gini coefficient of topics/authors in ranked feed.
- **Reduction of Harm**: Rate of harmful content exposure, moderation intervention rates.
- **A/B Testing**: Deploy different ranking models to user/server cohorts, compare engagement, wellbeing, and harm metrics.
- **Federated Metrics**: Track impact per server and cross-server propagation.

## 5. Deployment Considerations

- **Scalability:**
  - Use distributed/federated model serving (e.g., on each BlueSky instance).
  - Deploy ranking as a service (appview) or client-side module
  - Cache ranking results, batch API calls, and use efficient model inference.
- **Moderation:**
  - Integrate with BlueSky's moderation APIs and local policies.
  - Allow instance-level overrides and human-in-the-loop review.
- **Privacy:**
  - Employ federated learning and differential privacy for user data.
  - Minimize data retention and centralization.
- **Federation & Interoperability:**
  - Ensure ranking logic is protocol-compliant and can exchange signals across instances.
  - Use open standards for model updates and feedback sharing.
  - Normalize scores across servers; support interoperability with custom ranking services.
- **Anti-Gaming:**
  - Detect manipulation via anomaly detection (e.g., sudden engagement spikes, coordinated inauthentic behavior, such as coordinated reposts).
  - Rate-limit suspicious accounts, require additional verification, and adapt scoring weights.

## 6. Example Code Snippets

### Content Scoring Function
```python
def score_post(post, ml_model, moderation_api, feedback_db, federation_api):
    features = extract_features(post)
    humanity_score = ml_model.predict(features)
    moderation_score = moderation_api.get_signal(post['id'])
    feedback_score = feedback_db.get_feedback(post['id'])
    federated_score = federation_api.aggregate(post['id'])
    return combine_scores(humanity_score, moderation_score, feedback_score, federated_score)
```

### BlueSky API Integration (Python, AT Protocol)
```python
import atproto
client = atproto.Client()
posts = client.get_feed(limit=100)
for post in posts:
    # process post
    pass
```

### Feedback Loop Example
```python
def update_model_with_feedback(model, feedback_data):
    # Retrain or fine-tune model with new feedback
    model.fit(feedback_data['features'], feedback_data['labels'])
    return model
```
