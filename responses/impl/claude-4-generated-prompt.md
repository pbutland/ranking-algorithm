## Special Considerations

**Vulnerable Voices**: Do not penalize authentic expressions of distress, trauma, or marginalized experiences. Consider whether such content could lead to support, awareness, or positive intervention.

**Cultural Sensitivity**: Recognize that "helping humanity" may manifest differently across cultures while maintaining universal human rights principles.

**Context Matters**: Consider the poster's intent, audience, and potential ripple effects. Sometimes difficult truths or uncomfortable content serves humanity's long-term interests.

**Authenticity vs. Performance**: Favor genuine content over performative virtue signaling that lacks substance or follow-through.
