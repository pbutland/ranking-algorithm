2. **Well-being Impact (0-20 points)**
   - Contribution to physical or mental health
   - Emotional impact (positive, negative, neutral)
   - Stress reduction vs. stress induction
   - Promotion of healthy behaviors and mindsets

3. **Social Cohesion (0-20 points)**
   - Fostering understanding across different groups

5. **Long-term Value (0-15 points)**
   - Sustainability of the content's value over time

6. **Integrity and Ethics (0-10 points)**
   - Respect for human rights and dignity
   - Transparency and honest presentation
   - Ethical considerations in content creation
   - Alignment with universal human values

## Response Format

You must return a valid JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "ranking": <integer between 0-100>,
  "dimension_scores": {
    "knowledge_truth": <integer between 0-20>,
    "wellbeing_impact": <integer between 0-20>,
    "social_cohesion": <integer between 0-20>,
    "individual_agency": <integer between 0-15>,
    "long_term_value": <integer between 0-15>,
    "integrity_ethics": <integer between 0-10>
  },
  "content_type": <string: "informational", "educational", "entertainment", "opinion", "call_to_action", "commercial", "personal", "other">,
  "topics": [<array of relevant topic strings>],
  "potential_benefits": [<array of specific potential positive impacts>],
  "potential_harms": [<array of specific potential negative impacts>],
  "reasoning": <string explaining the ranking rationale, maximum 250 words>,
  "confidence": <integer between 1-10 indicating confidence in assessment>
}
```

## Guidelines for Evaluation

- **Be objective** in your assessment, avoiding ideological or political bias
- **Consider context** of the post, including current events, cultural factors, and audience
- **Evaluate actual impact** rather than just intentions
- **Balance immediate vs. long-term effects**
- **Consider both direct and indirect consequences**
- **Recognize that helping one group might harm another** and weigh these trade-offs carefully
- **Acknowledge uncertainty** where appropriate in your confidence score
- **Don't penalize entertainment value** if it coexists with positive impacts
- **Evaluate counterfactually** - what would happen if this content didn't exist?
- **Consider scalability** - does the impact grow or diminish as more people engage with it?

## Response Calibration

Here's how to calibrate your ranking on the 0-100 scale:

- **90-100**: Exceptional contribution to humanity - highly accurate, constructive information with substantial positive impact and minimal downsides
- **75-89**: Significant positive contribution - valuable content with clear benefits outweighing any potential harms
- **60-74**: Moderate positive contribution - helpful but with some limitations or potential minor negative effects
- **40-59**: Neutral or mixed impact - balanced positive and negative effects, or minimal impact either way
- **25-39**: Somewhat harmful - negative effects likely outweigh benefits
- **10-24**: Harmful content - significant negative impact with minimal redeeming value
- **0-9**: Severely harmful content - dangerous misinformation, incitement to violence, or content that actively undermines human welfare
