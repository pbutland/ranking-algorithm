# Social Media Ranking Algorithm Research

This repository is an experimental space for developing and testing ranking algorithms that prioritize **social benefits** over traditional metrics like engagement, profit, or traffic.

## Purpose

Current social media platforms optimize for metrics that maximize user attention and platform revenue, often at the expense of user wellbeing and societal health. This project explores alternative approaches to content ranking that could:

- Promote constructive discourse and meaningful interactions
- Reduce the spread of misinformation and harmful content
- Encourage diverse perspectives and reduce echo chambers
- Support mental health and positive user experiences
- Foster community building and genuine connections

## What's Inside

This repository contains various prompts and LLM responses related to developing ranking algorithms with a social-first approach. The goal is to research and prototype systems that measure content value beyond simple engagement metrics.

## Approach

Rather than optimizing for clicks, likes, or time-on-platform, we're exploring ranking factors that could include:

- Content accuracy and factual reliability
- Constructive vs. divisive communication patterns
- Educational or informational value
- Community building potential
- Long-term user satisfaction and wellbeing

## Status

This is an active research project. Ideas, contributions, and discussions are welcome as we explore how technology can better serve human flourishing.
