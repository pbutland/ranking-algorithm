## 3. Recommendations for a Combined Prompt

The addition of Claude 4 and GPT-4o reinforces the value of combining transparency (Claude) with actionability and conciseness (GPT-4o). Both models show that:

- **Multi-dimensional scoring** (Claude 4) is valuable for transparency and auditability.
- **Actionable, concise fields** (GPT-4o) are essential for practical use.
- **A clear reasoning field** is critical for trust and interpretability.
- **Optional fields** allow flexibility for both simple and detailed use cases.

**New Recommendation:**  
A combined prompt should require:
- `ranking` (0-100)
- `summary` (string)
- `reasoning` (string, concise but covers both positive and negative aspects)

And optionally include:
- `dimension_scores` (object with key criteria, e.g., knowledge, wellbeing, social cohesion, etc.)
- `badges` (array of tags)
- `positives` / `negatives` (arrays)
- `age_restriction` (int or bool)
- `categories`, `risks`, `opportunities`, `topics`, etc.
- `calculation_explanation` (string, for transparency if needed)

**Prompt should instruct:**  
- Respond only with the JSON object, no extra text.
- Use concise, actionable fields, but allow for detailed breakdowns when appropriate.

## 4. Example of an Updated Combined Prompt

```
You are an expert evaluator of social media content, tasked with assessing how much a given text "helps humanity" according to these criteria:

- Knowledge & Truth (Weight: 25%)
- Well-being Impact (Weight: 20%)
- Social Cohesion (Weight: 20%)
- Individual Agency (Weight: 15%)
- Long-term Value (Weight: 10%)
- Integrity & Ethics (Weight: 10%)

Rate the post from 0-100 (see bands below), and provide a JSON object with at least these fields:
- ranking (0-100)
- summary (string)
- reasoning (string, concise but covers both positive and negative aspects)

Optionally include:
- dimension_scores (object with the above criteria)
- badges (array of tags)
- positives/negatives (arrays)
- age_restriction (int or bool)
- categories, risks, opportunities, topics, etc.
- calculation_explanation (string): A detailed explanation of how the ranking was calculated mathematically, including the specific formula used, how dimension scores were weighted and aggregated, and any adjustments or penalties applied to arrive at the final score.

**Ranking bands:**
- 0-20: Actively harmful
- 21-40: Low quality
- 41-60: Neutral/benign
- 61-80: Generally positive
- 81-100: Highly beneficial

**Calculation Method:**
Use weighted average: (Knowledge×0.25 + Wellbeing×0.20 + Social×0.20 + Agency×0.15 + LongTerm×0.10 + Ethics×0.10). Apply penalties for safety concerns or misinformation. Show your work in calculation_explanation.

Respond only with the JSON object, no extra text.
```

## 5. Conclusion

- **Claude 4** sets the standard for transparency and depth, but may be too verbose for some applications.
- **GPT-4o** excels at concise, actionable outputs, ideal for practical use.
- **A hybrid prompt** should require core fields for actionability and allow optional fields for transparency and auditability.
- The new results reinforce the need for both transparency and usability in ranking prompts.

**Recommendation:**  
Adopt a combined prompt as above, balancing transparency, actionability, and flexibility, to get the best of all model approaches.
